        Logging in Spring Boot plays a vital role in Spring Boot applications for recording information, actions,
        and events within the app. It is also used for monitoring the performance of an application, understanding
        the behavior of the application, and recognizing the issues within the application.
        Spring Boot offers flexible logging capabilities by providing various logging frameworks and also provides
        ways to manage and configure the logs.
